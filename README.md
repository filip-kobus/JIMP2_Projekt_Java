## Introduction
This project is a Java-based application designed to open and solve mazes using various algorithms. It provides a graphical user interface to visualize the maze and the solving process. The application is structured to be modular and extensible, allowing easy integration of new maze generation and solving algorithms.

## Features
- Open maze from text or binary files.
- Solve mazes using various algorithms (BFS and DFS).
- Visualize the maze generation and solving processes.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
    ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd maze-generator-and-solver
   ```

3. **Compile the project:**
   ```sh
   javac -d bin src/*.java
    ```
   
4. **Run the project:**
    ```sh
    java -cp bin Main
     ```

## Usage
1. Launch the application by running the `Main` class.
2. Use the graphical user interface to generate and solve mazes.
3. Select the desired algorithm for maze generation and solving from the interface.

## Classes Overview
- `Main`: The entry point of the application.
- `MazeRenderer`: Handles the graphical representation of the maze.
- `MazeUtilities`: Provides utility functions for maze operations.
- `MainGuiPanel`: Manages the main graphical user interface panel.
- `FileIO`: Handles file input and output operations.
- `AlgorithmDfs`: Implements the Depth-First Search algorithm for maze generation and solving.
- `AlgorithmBfs`: Implements the Breadth-First Search algorithm for maze solving.
- `Binary`: Contains utility functions related to binary operations.
- `DataArray`: Manages the data structures used in the maze.
- `Point`: Represents a point in the maze.
